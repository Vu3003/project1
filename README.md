## Motivation:

In this project, I want to figure out how do the gender, user type, user age affect on individual rides made in a bike-sharing system

I want to find the answer for those questions:

1. **How member age distribution**
2. **Is there any relationship between duration second and day of week**
3. **Is there any relationship between duration second and gender**
